Running the code:
This code includes packages not found in the original environment. Thus installing these packages might be needed to run the code. 

Each step from Assignment 2 includes one file containing the used model and one data file named 'A2_data_step_"stepnumber"'. For the model files, the stepnumber is used at the beginning of the filename to indicate the corresponding step.
In case a step required more optimizations than one, multiple pairs of files were created and named accordingly. For example: Step 2.4 requires two files, one for the in-sample and one of the out-of-sample (oos) analysis.
